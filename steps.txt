Lets use Create React App:
npm install -g create-react-app


1. create-react-app <project-name>
2. add bootstrap 4 cdn [for styling - because I'm too lazy to style them nicely]
3. clean up the code and make a decent project structure
4. We only need App.js and index.js [with some more cleanup]
5. add components, pages and data folder
6. add movies.js in data
7. implement getMovies function
8. think about how can we make reusable components to build this app
9. Add some content in MoviePage component and import it in <App />
10. Lets build Card and Image with dummy content
11. Add them in MoviePage
12. Make it more granular and add content from Bootstrap Card component
13. fetch Movies in <MoviePage /> component, pass down data and loop it through Cards
14. Make necessary adjustments
15. Finish it up !
